<h1> Mother Teresa Quotes</h1>

<div id="row">

<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-8" id="p1">
<h3 id="hbox1">Love</h3><br/ ><br/ >
<p>Spread love everywhere you go,Let no one ever come to you without leaving happy.
If you judge people, you have no time to love them.If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.
Peace begins with a smile.If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one.
Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.</p>
